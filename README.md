ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to recommend the top 3 closest job roles based on skill similarity. Given an input job role, we calculate similarity using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity to match roles effectively.

ðŸ“Œ Approach & Methodology
Data Preprocessing
Extracted skills associated with each job role.
Converted them into a structured text format for vectorization.
Feature Engineering (TF-IDF)
Used TF-IDF Vectorizer instead of CountVectorizer.
TF-IDF gives lower weight to commonly occurring skills while highlighting unique ones.
Similarity Calculation (Cosine Similarity)
Measured the angle between job roles in vector space.
Higher cosine similarity â†’ More skill overlap â†’ More relevant job recommendations.
Ranking & Recommendation
Found the top 3 most similar job roles for a given input.
Displayed recommendations with similarity scores

ðŸ“Œ Results & Output
Example Input: "Data Scientist"
Top 3 Recommended Roles:
ML Engineer
AI Researcher
Data Analyst
